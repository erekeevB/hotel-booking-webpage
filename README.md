# Hotel Chain Front-End

Made with React. Used Redux, React-Select, React-Datepicker. Simple Hotel room booking webpage with Admin panel to manage Database Stuff from backend (Used Dummy Data just to demonstate it).

# Admin Page, Manager Page, Desk Clerk Page

These pages were meant to control the database table rows without interacting with the backend (much like what CMS will do). Also, these pages were depending on the Role (Admin, Manager, Desk Clerk, User) and did not show up (Redirected to Main Page even if tried) if other Role wanted to open it. However, for demonstration purposes, I allowed everyone to access these pages.

# Panel Lists

I tried to create a mini library that will take array of objects, and turn them into a Table that can add or delete rows (Needs Delete and Add functions passes into a component).
